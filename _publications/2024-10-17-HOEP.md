Exceptional points, a remarkable phenomenon in physical systems, have been exploited for sensing applications. It has been demonstrated recently that it can also utilize as sensory threshold in which the interplay between exceptional-point dynamics and noise can lead to enhanced performance. Most existing works focused on second-order exceptional points. We investigate the stochastic dynamics associated with high-order exceptional points with a particular eye towards optimizing sensing performance by developing a theoretical framework based on pseudo-Hermiticity. Our analysis reveals three distinct types of frequency responses to external perturbations. A broad type of stochastic resonance is uncovered where, as the noise amplitude increases, the signal-to-noise ratio reaches a global maximum rapidly but with a slow decaying process afterwards, indicating achievable high performance in a wide range of the noise level. These results suggest that stochastic high-order exceptional-point dynamics can be exploited for applications in signal processing and sensor technologies.
